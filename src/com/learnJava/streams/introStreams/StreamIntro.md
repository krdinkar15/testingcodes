Streams are an update to java API  that lets you manipulate collection of data in a declarative way.

Stream can be processed in parallel transparently, without you having to write any multithreaded code.

Stream is sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations.

Collections are about data. Streams are about computations.

Stream consume from a data-providing source such as collections, arrays, or I/O resource.
Generating a stream of ordered  collection preserve the ordering.


Many stream operation return a stream themselves, allowing operations to be chained and form a larger pipeline.

Collection are iterated explicitly using a iterator.
Stream operation do the iteration behind the scene for you.


you can consume a stream only once.
